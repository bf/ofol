# lite-xl-language-containerfile

## Overview

Lite-XL Syntax Highlighting for Containerfile/Dockerfile.
It's a very basic Lite-XL Syntax Highlighting plugin.
It definitely could use some extra love to make some more intelligent detection.

A `Containerfile` is provided as an example of what it would look like when the plugin is installed.

## Requirements

* Lite-XL v2.0.5 or newer

## Usage

Clone the project to the User Module Directory.
Refer to the [Lite-XL Documentation: Usage](https://lite-xl.com/?/documentation/usage) for more information on where this is for your system.
The example given here is for Linux/MacOS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilBot3/lite-xl-language-containerfile.git ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/language_containerfile
```

Restart Lite-XL, and it should start working.
